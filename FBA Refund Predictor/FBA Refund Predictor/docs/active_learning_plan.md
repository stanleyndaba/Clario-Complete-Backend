# Active Learning Plan

## Strategy

1. **Uncertainty Sampling**: Select instances with highest prediction uncertainty
2. **Human Review**: Manual labeling of uncertain cases
3. **Incremental Training**: Retrain model with new labeled data
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Track improvements over time

## Implementation

### Sampling Strategy
- Entropy-based uncertainty sampling
- Diversity sampling to avoid redundancy
- Batch sampling for efficiency

### Feedback Loop
- Web interface for human labeling
- Quality control for label consistency
- Automated retraining triggers

### Monitoring
- Performance improvement tracking
- Label quality assessment
- Cost-benefit analysis

## Tools

- Uncertainty quantification
- Human-in-the-loop interface
- Automated retraining pipeline
- Performance dashboards

## üîß Continuous Learning Components

### 1. **RejectionLogger** - Enhanced with Processing Status
```python
# Track processing status
status = rejection_logger.get_processing_status()
print(f"Processed: {status['processed']}")
print(f"Unprocessed: {status['unprocessed']}")
print(f"Queue: {len(status['processing_queue'])} items")

# Mark rejections as processed
rejection_logger.mark_rejection_processed(tracking_id, results)
```

### 2. **DetectorFeedbackLoop** - Enhanced with Automation
```python
# Automatic processing
auto_result = feedback_loop.auto_process_rejections(max_rejections=50)
print(f"Processed: {auto_result['total_processed']}")
print(f"Alerts: {auto_result['alerts_generated']}")

# Health monitoring
health = feedback_loop.monitor_system_health()
print(f"Status: {health['status']}")
for alert in health['alerts']:
    print(f"{alert['level']}: {alert['message']}")

# Continuous learning summary
summary = feedback_loop.get_continuous_learning_summary()
print(f"Rejections learned: {summary['learning_metrics']['total_rejections_learned']}")
```

### 3. **KnowledgeBaseSync** - Ready for Growth
```python
# Update successful templates
template_id = knowledge_base_sync.update_successful_template(
    claim_type="lost",
    claim_text="Item lost with proper documentation",
    evidence_used=["tracking_proof", "invoice"]
)

# Update edge cases
edge_case_id = knowledge_base_sync.update_edge_case(
    claim_type="damaged",
    description="Items older than 18 months not eligible",
    is_success=False,
    special_requirements="Check item age before filing"
)
```

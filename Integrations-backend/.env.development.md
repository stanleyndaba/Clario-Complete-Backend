# Environment Variables for Development Mode

## Required for 50K Dataset Sync

Add these to your `.env` file to enable syncing with imported data:

```bash
# Enable development mode to use imported data
NODE_ENV=development
USE_IMPORTED_DATA=true

# Optional: Disable mock data generation (use database only)
USE_MOCK_DATA_GENERATOR=false
```

## What These Do

- **`NODE_ENV=development`**: Enables development features and safeguards
- **`USE_IMPORTED_DATA=true`**: Tells Agent 2 to ignore seller_id filtering and sync ANY imported data from the database
- **`USE_MOCK_DATA_GENERATOR=false`**: Prevents fallback to mock generation (optional, but recommended to ensure you're using real imported data)

## Security Note

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: `USE_IMPORTED_DATA=true` should **NEVER** be used in production as it allows syncing data across seller boundaries. This is only safe for development/testing environments where you control all the data.

## How to Apply

1. Copy the environment variables above
2. Add to your `.env` file in the `Integrations-backend` directory
3. Restart the backend server
4. Run a sync - it will now use your imported 50K dataset

## Verification

After setting these variables and restarting, you should see logs like:

```
📦 [AGENT 2] Found 25000 orders in database (imported data) [DEV MODE: ignoring seller_id]
🚚 [AGENT 2] Found 18000 shipments in database (imported data) [DEV MODE]
```

The `[DEV MODE]` indicator confirms the seller_id filter is disabled.
